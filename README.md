# decalendar

We developed yet another javascript calendar UI to fullfil our needs.
The UI can be hooked to data storage via json configurable js callbacks.

The defining principles applied

* modular source code: require-modules via broserify
* extendable: json configuration that can override any defaults and callbacks
* mobile-first design for touch devices
* calendar tracks/swimlanes to represent different resources
